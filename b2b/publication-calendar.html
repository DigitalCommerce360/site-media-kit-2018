B2B sites must offer customers contract pricing, multiple levels of authorized access, site search that can handle highly complex products and systems, highly elaborate product configurators, re-ordering forms for frequently ordered commodities, and multiple ship-to addresses. And buyers are demanding more of the high level of customer experience they're accustomed to on retail sites, such as the ability to quickly find, cart and purchase products; 360-degree product imaging, and product demonstration and how-to installation videos. This report will cover the latest trends in these areas and provide inside looks at how several companies are deploying effective site designs. </p>

          <td> The internet is disrupting wholesaling, and wholesalers and distributors are investing in new e-commerce technology to meet that challenge. But like the manufacturers that supply them, wholesalers and distributors need to get beyond competing on price and availability, and deliver an excellent online customer experience that includes deep product information, convenient payment options and integration into customers’ accounting systems. What’s more, these companies need to take full advantage of fast-growing online marketplaces like Amazon Business, eBay, Walmart.com and Newegg Business. There are 300,000 wholesalers in the U.S. but 50 of the largest companies generate 25% of all industry revenue, says the U.S. Small Business Administration. How fast are wholesalers and distributors making the transition to B2B e-commerce and which ones are moving the fastest? In its report to be published in March 2018, B2BecNews analyzes the trends, technology and business practices driving wholesale e-commerce forward and highlights which wholesalers and distributors are ahead of the game.

A 2017 survey Deloitte finds that 75% of executives believe that web procurement will play a much larger role in their company’s overall digital strategy going forward. But how effective are the latest e-procurement software applications and networks in accomplishing these goals?

Automotive purchasing agents also use commerce-enabled networks and portals to make more informed buying decisions. This report to be published in February 2018 analyzes and sizes up the automotive B2B e-commerce market and highlights which manufacturers, suppliers and dealers are putting e-commerce into over drive while others remain stuck on the side of the road with outdated supply chains and sales channels. </p>
